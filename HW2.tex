Because of the reliance of the particular assignments in this class on mathematical notation, 
and the fact that all assignments will be submitted electronically, 
students are encouraged to use \LaTeX{} to formalize their responses. 
\textbf{For those enrolled in the graduate section the use of latex is \emph{required}.}
This assignment (like all others) will be posted on the course \texttt{github}\footnote{\url{github.com/deblasiolab/CS4364-documents}} as source code as well as in PDF form on the course website. 
Please submit your assignment to the professor via email, either as a link to your assignment online (i.e. overleaf or github) or as an attachment. 
Graduate students will need to include the \texttt{.tex} files as well as a PDF, this is optional but encouraged for undergraduates. 


\begin{enumerate}


\item \textbf{(20 points)} 
Given two sequences $S$ and $T$ (not necessarily the same length), 
let $G$, $L$, and $H$ be the scores of an optimal global alignment, an optimal local alignment, 
and an optimal global alignment without counting the indels at the beginning of $S$ and the end of $T$, respectively. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Give an example of $S$ and $T$ so that all 3 scores, $G$, $L$, and $H$, are different. 
\item Prove or disprove the statement $L \ge H \ge G$.
\end{enumerate}

Note: for the proof, this can be a sketch, you just need to convince me that you're correct. 

%\item \textbf{(1 Point)}
%Under the affine gap model, describe an algorithm that find the optimal \textit{local} alignment of strings $S[1...n]$ and $T[1...m]$ in $O(mn)$-time. 

\item \textbf{(20 points)} 
Given two strings $S[1...n]$ and $T[1...m]$, we would like to find the two non-overlapping alignments 
($S[i_1...i_2],T[j_1...j_2]$) and ($S[i_3...i_4],T[j_3...j_4]$) such that $i_2<i_3$ and $j_2<j_3$ and the total alignment score is maximized 
in running time $O(mn)$. 
Hints: remember that the local alignment between two sequences is the alignment of a pair of substrings from $S$ and $T$ such that the alignment score is maximized, 
and that the question does not say anything about the relationship between $i_1$ and $i_2$ nor $i_3$ and $i_4$ that if $i_3>i_4, S[i_3...i_4]$ is the empty string.
\end{enumerate}
