\begin{enumerate}


\item
Assume that we compare the sequences below by counting the number of shared $3$-mers (that is how many of the unique $3$-mers in one sequence are also in the other). 
For the following sequences, which pair is more similar. 
\begin{itemize}
\item $S_1$ = \texttt{ACGTCGATC}
\item $S_2$ = \texttt{CCGGCGTCA}
\item $S_3$ = \texttt{ACGCTCGAT}
\end{itemize}


Does this change if we look at $2$-mers?

Hint: It will help to create a list of all of the possible $k$-mers and their existence in each of the strings then use that list to calculate the count for each pair of sequences. 



\item
Given a set of sequences $S_1, S_2, S_3, ..., S_k$, we would like to find $k$ substrings $T_1,T_2,T_3,...,T_k$ of $S_1, S_2, S_3, ..., S_k$ respectively, 
such that the optimal SP score of the multiple sequence alignment of  $T_1,T_2,T_3,...,T_k$ is maximized. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Design a dynamic programming algorithm to solve the problem with match, mismatch, and indel penalties of $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ respectively (i.e. not affine gap scoring). 
\item What is the time complexity? Explain your answer. 
\end{enumerate}
Note that when $k=2$, this problem is the same as pairwise local alignment. 


\end{enumerate}
