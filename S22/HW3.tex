%Because of the reliance of the particular assignments in this class on mathematical notation, 
%and the fact that all assignments will be submitted electronically, 
%students are encouraged to use \LaTeX{} to formalize their responses. 
%\textbf{For those enrolled in the graduate section the use of latex is \emph{required}.}
%This assignment (like all others) will be posted on the course \texttt{github}\footnote{\url{github.com/deblasiolab/CS4364-documents}} as source code as well as in PDF form on the course website. 
%Please submit your assignment to the professor via email, either as a link to your assignment online (i.e. overleaf or github) or as an attachment. 
%Graduate students will need to include the \texttt{.tex} files as well as a PDF, this is optional but encouraged for undergraduates.

\emph{Profile Alignment Problem} Given two sequence profiles $T$ and $S$,  of sizes $\sigma \times n$ and $\sigma \times m$ respectively 
(that is each represents a sequence of length $n$ [$m$], but with probabilities of each character from the alphabet at each position), 
determine the optimal alignment (i.e. which columns of $S$ align with which columns of $T$) under the scoring scheme $\delta$.

Your task: \textbf{modify} the Needlman-Wunch global alignment algorithm to consider these profiles rather than sequences. 
You can assume that the replacement costs are defined in a function $\delta(a,b) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} , \forall a,b \in \Sigma \cup \{'-'\}$.
Give the algorithm, an explanation of correctness, and analysis of it's running time. 

An example alignment is shown below over the alphabet $\Sigma=\{\texttt{A},\texttt{C},\texttt{T},\texttt{G}\}$, as well as it's alignment score. 
Note that the score for a column is now no longer the value of $\delta$ for the two characters being aligned, but the weighted sum of these values.
