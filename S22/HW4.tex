%Because of the reliance of the particular assignments in this class on mathematical notation, 
%and the fact that all assignments will be submitted electronically, 
%students are encouraged to use \LaTeX{} to formalize their responses. 
%\textbf{For those enrolled in the graduate section the use of latex is \emph{required}.}
%This assignment (like all others) will be posted on the course \texttt{github}\footnote{\url{github.com/deblasiolab/CS4364-documents}} as source code as well as in PDF form on the course website. 
%Please submit your assignment to the professor via email, either as a link to your assignment online (i.e. overleaf or github) or as an attachment. 
%Graduate students will need to include the \texttt{.tex} files as well as a PDF, this is optional but encouraged for undergraduates. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{(20 points)} 
Describe how to \emph{use} the suffix tree data structure to find the longest \textit{palindrome} substring in a string $S$. 
Remember a palindrome is a string that is the same forward as in reverse (i.e. \texttt{tacocat}). 
The longest palindrome substring in the example string \texttt{bananas} is \texttt{anana}:
it is both a substring (from the 2nd to 6th characters) and is a palindrome. 
Include in the submission: (1) an algorithm, (2) an explanation of its correctness, and (3) an analysis of it's running time.


\end{enumerate}
