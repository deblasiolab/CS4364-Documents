Because of the reliance of the particular assignments in this class on mathematical notation, 
and the fact that all assignments will be submitted electronically, 
students are encouraged to use \LaTeX{} to formalize their responses. 
\textbf{For those enrolled in the graduate section the use of latex is \emph{required}.}
This assignment (like all others) will be posted on the course \texttt{github}\footnote{\url{github.com/deblasiolab/CS4364-documents}} as source code as well as in PDF form on the course website. 
%Please submit your assignment to the professor via email, either as a link to your assignment online (i.e. overleaf or github) or as an attachment. 
Graduate students will need to include the \texttt{.tex} files as well as a PDF, this is optional but encouraged for undergraduates. 

\textbf{Question (25 points):} 
Give an algorithm, a proof of correctness, and proof of running time to solve the following problem in $O(kn^2c)$-time.

Given integers $k$ and $c$, as well as two strings $S$ and $T$ both of length $n >> k$, determine a similarity between them that is calculated as the sum of: 
\begin{itemize}
\item $c+1$ times the number of shared distinct exact $k$-mers
\item $c$ times the number of shared distinct $k$-mers with one change that have not been accounted for already
\item $c-1$ times the number of shared distinct $k$-mers with two changes that have not been accounted for already
\item ...
\item $1$ times the number of shared distinct $k$-mers with $c$ changes that have not been accounted for already
\end{itemize}
normalized by the total number of distinct $k$-mers in both sequences.
Here changes are replacements only and not indels. 

As an example for the values of $k=3, c=2$ and the strings \texttt{AACTGT} and \texttt{TGTAAA} the similarity is $\frac{3}{4}$. 
The distinct $3$-mers from the two strings are \texttt{AAC,ACT,CTG,TGT} and \texttt{TGT,GTA,TAA,AAA}.
There is one $3$-mer that matches exactly (\texttt{TGT}).
There is one pair of $3$-mers that match with one change (\texttt{AAC} and \texttt{AAA}).
There is one pair of $3$-mers that match with two changes (\texttt{CTG} and \texttt{GTA})
The remaining pair would need 3 changes (i.e. more than $c$ changes). 
Thus the similarity is 
\[
\frac{(1\times 3) + (1 \times 2) + (1 \times 1)}{8} = \frac{3}{4}.
\]
