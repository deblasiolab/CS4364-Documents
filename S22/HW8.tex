\maketitle

\textbf{(10 points)} This homework is not technical, therefore students do not ned to submit their responses using \LaTeX, 
but they should submit a PDF or plain text file (\texttt{.txt}, not a Word Document or other file types). 
%Because of the reliance of the particular assignments in this class on mathematical notation, 
%and the fact that all assignments will be submitted electronically, 
%students are encouraged to use \LaTeX{} to formalize their responses. 
%\textbf{For those enrolled in the graduate section the use of latex is \emph{required}.}
%This assignment (like all others) will be posted on the course \texttt{github}\footnote{\url{github.com/deblasiolab/CS4364-documents}} as source code as well as in PDF form on the course website. 
%Please submit your assignment to the professor via email, either as a link to your assignment online (i.e. overleaf or github) or as an attachment. 
%Graduate students will need to include the \texttt{.tex} files as well as a PDF, this is optional but encouraged for undergraduates. 
If you are working as a group \emph{each person in the group must submit \textbf{the same} file to blackboard}.

We want to start thinking about the final project, and what work you will be completing (possibly as a group). 

\begin{enumerate}
\item If the page is already existing, what is missing and/or how is the current content lacking? 

\item What structural changes will you be making to the page (if it is new, what is the structure you will be implementing)? 

\item What content will you be adding (and if a group who will be accomplishing each element)? 

\item Where are you looking to add primary sources (i.e. textbook chapters/websites that will lead you to primary literature)? 

\item What related pages will you be linking to within your new article? 

\end{enumerate}
